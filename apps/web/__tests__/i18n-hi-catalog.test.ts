/**
 * Audit I-03 / I18N-05 — the Hindi copy that was already written, finally in a
 * catalog something can read.
 *
 * The finding: "CONTENT_LABELS.hi authors 18 keys … ContentPageHeader.tsx reads
 * exactly three of them … the other 15 translated labels are never rendered
 * anywhere", and its fix says in as many words that this "is a wiring change
 * against copy that already exists — no new translation needed."
 *
 * THE SPLIT, STATED PLAINLY. That fix had two halves and this file closed one.
 *   - The CATALOG half is here: the human-authored Hindi is lifted out of the
 *     component-local CONTENT_LABELS map and into lib/i18n/hi.json under the
 *     key names en.json already uses, so the render half becomes a one-line
 *     `t('content', locale)` swap instead of a copy hunt.
 *   - The RENDER half is now done too (2026-08-19) and is guarded by
 *     __tests__/i18n/content-page-locale.i03.test.tsx, which renders /content
 *     with the locale cookie on `hi` and asserts on the emitted HTML. THAT is
 *     the test that can fail when a devotee sees English; nothing in THIS file
 *     can. Everything here asserts a string reached a JSON file — which stayed
 *     green for the whole period /content shipped "Views" hardcoded in JSX.
 *
 * PROVENANCE IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS NOW MACHINE-CHECKED. lib/t.ts:23-31
 * claims "Nothing here is machine-translated". That was a comment; below it is
 * an assertion. Every string in every non-English catalog must appear verbatim
 * inside a Hindi source a human wrote in this repo — app/hi/page.tsx and the
 * CONTENT_LABELS.hi block in components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx. A machine
 * translation cannot pass, because it would be a string that exists nowhere
 * else. Note the corpus deliberately EXCLUDES app/mr/page.tsx: Marathi is also
 * written in Devanagari, and letting Marathi copy vouch for a Hindi string is
 * exactly the kind of silent error this guard exists to stop.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL MISSING IS COPY, NOT CODE — see the coverage assertions at the
 * bottom, which pin the real numbers so nobody can imply a finished
 * localisation. ta/te/bn/mr are still 0 of 374 and are deliberately left that
 * way: four keys of Tamil in an English chrome is the "looks deliberate, so the
 * user assumes the rest is untranslatable" harm I-03 describes.
